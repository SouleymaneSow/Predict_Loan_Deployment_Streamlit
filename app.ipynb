Il s'agit d'un outil de déploiement de modèle récent qui simplifie l'ensemble du cycle de déploiement de modèle et vous permet de déployer vos modèles rapidement. J'explore cet outil depuis quelques semaines et selon mon expérience, c'est un outil de déploiement de modèle simple, rapide et interprétable.\n","\n","Voici quelques-unes des fonctionnalités clés de Streamlit que j'ai trouvées vraiment intéressantes et utiles :\n","\n"," - Il transforme rapidement les scripts de données en applications Web partageables . Il vous suffit de transmettre un script en cours d'exécution à l'outil et il peut le convertir en une application Web.\n"," - **Tout en Python** . La meilleure chose à propos de Streamlit est que tout ce que nous faisons est en Python. Du chargement du modèle à la création du frontend, tout peut être fait en utilisant Python.\n"," -**Le tout gratuitement** . C'est open source et donc aucun coût n'est impliqué. Vous pouvez déployer vos applications sans les payer.\n"," - **Aucune expérience en front-end requise** . Le déploiement du modèle contient généralement deux parties, le frontend et le backend. Le backend est généralement un modèle de travail, un modèle d'apprentissage automatique dans notre cas, qui est un python intégré. Et la partie frontale, qui nécessite généralement une certaine connaissance d'autres langages comme les scripts java, etc. En utilisant Streamlit, nous pouvons créer ce frontal en Python lui-même. Nous n'avons donc pas besoin d'apprendre d'autres langages de programmation ou techniques de développement Web. Comprendre Python est suffisant."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Rl2j2-T0xrOG"},"source":["Disons que nous déployons le modèle sans utiliser Streamlit. Dans ce cas, l'ensemble du pipeline ressemblera à ceci :\n","\n"," - Construction de modèles\n"," - Création d'un script python\n"," - Écrire l'application Flask\n"," - Créer un front-end : JavaScript\n"," - Déployer\n","Nous allons d'abord construire notre modèle et le convertir en un script python. Ensuite, nous devrons créer l'application Web en utilisant disons flask. Nous devrons également créer le front end pour l'application Web et ici, nous devrons utiliser JavaScript. Et puis enfin, nous allons déployer le modèle. Donc, si vous le remarquez, nous aurons besoin des connaissances de Python pour construire le modèle, puis d'une compréhension approfondie de JavaScript et de Flask pour construire le front-end et déployer le modèle. Examinons maintenant le pipeline de déploiement si nous utilisons Streamlit :\n","\n"," - Construction de modèles\n"," - Création d'un script python\n"," - Créer un front-end : Python\n"," - Déployer\n","\n","Ici, nous allons construire le modèle et créer un script python pour celui-ci. Ensuite, nous allons construire le front-end de l'application qui sera en python et enfin, nous allons déployer le modèle. C'est ça. Notre modèle sera déployé. N'est-ce pas incroyable? Si vous connaissez python, le déploiement de modèles à l'aide de Streamlit sera un voyage facile. J'espère que vous êtes aussi enthousiasmé par Streamlit que je l'étais en l'explorant plus tôt. Alors, sans plus tarder, créons notre propre application Web à l'aide de Streamlit."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WkRPxwkzyTrv"},"source":["Nous allons commencer par les installations
